Spring Boot is a Java-based framework designed to simplify the development of stand-alone, production-ready Spring applications. It builds on top of the Spring Framework and removes the need for complex configuration by offering auto-configuration, embedded servers, and production-ready features out of the box.
Key Features and Benefits
Auto-Configuration: Automatically sets up application components based on added dependencies.
Embedded Servers: Runs with built-in Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, so no need for external deployment.
Production-Ready: Includes metrics, health checks, and monitoring via Spring Boot Actuator.
Simplified Setup: Reduces boilerplate code and XML configuration.
Starter Dependencies: Groups common dependencies into easy-to-use starters (e.g., spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa).
Adding Dependencies
Dependencies like JPA or Hibernate are added by including the appropriate starter in the pom.xml (Maven) or build.gradle (Gradle) file. For example:
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
Spring Boot automatically configures them based on the project setup.
Best IDE for Spring Boot
IntelliJ IDEA is widely regarded as the best IDE for Spring Boot due to its strong Spring support, intelligent code completion, built-in tools, and seamless integration. Spring Tools Suite (STS), Eclipse, and NetBeans are also viable, but IntelliJ offers the smoothest experience overall.
What is Spring Initializr?
Spring Initializr is a web-based tool that helps you quickly generate a Spring Boot project. You can choose the project type, language, dependencies, and packaging, then download a ready-to-use project to start coding immediately.
